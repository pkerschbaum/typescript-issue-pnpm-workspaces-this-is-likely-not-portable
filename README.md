## How to reproduce

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
# Error occurs: TS2742: The inferred type of 'app' cannot be named without a reference to '.pnpm/@types+express-serve-static-core@4.17.33/node_modules/@types/express-serve-static-core'. This is likely not portable. A type annotation is necessary.
```
